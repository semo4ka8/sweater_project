# Sweater project

In this project I am making a calculator for cardigan, knitted from top in the circle.

Input data will contain:

1. Sample measurments:
- width in cm or inches,
- height in cm or inches,
- width in stiches,
- height in rows.

2. Desired sweater measurments:
- neck around,
- bust half,
- under arm half,
- length total,
- length bottom to armpit,
- sleave wrist to armpit,
- neckopening height.

Based on sample and desired sweater measurments, this calculator should tell row by row instructions about:
- how many stiches are required to start,
- where to place markers on the knitting,
- where to make increases and decreases,
- where to disconnect arms from the whole part,
- what amount of rows is needed.
